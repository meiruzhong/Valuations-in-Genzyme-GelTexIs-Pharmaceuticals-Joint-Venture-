Calculated the GelTex project's next 10-year free cash flow based on the budgets and revenue forecasts for the joint venture. Discounted to get NPV and found it profitable by comparing the gains with initial investment and IRR.

Expanded the models by using real options approach and got the net NPV by assuming different scenarios with various possibilities. Concluded that this is not a good investment since Genzyme ends up losing money.
